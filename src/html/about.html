      <h3 class="f-4">What Problem Is This Trying to Solve?</h3>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        I am not a designer.  I also don't have access to someoneo who can choose a color palette for something I'm working on.  The ROI on a design professional is not always there.  And yet, I want something that will work and have some control over it.  But I don't want to have to endlessly tweak or make a lot of decisions.

      </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        Ideally, I can create a small palette comprised of a few colors, each in a few shades that all sorta work together.  Most combinations should have decent contrast and perhaps the palette can have one or two colors I really like or need.
      </p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy f-3">
        Ultimately, I want to quickly get a palette that's decent, and that won't require me to be forever tweaking or changing the palette as I work, even if a designer would do a better job.  Sometimes I don't even really know what colors I'm gonna need and just want to roll with something to get going.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-4">How does it work?</h3>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        You provide basic inputs and it will generate a palette.  You choose one or two colors, a number of colors (6 or 12), a color wheel to produce the colors, and a color scale to produce either 5 or 7 shades of each color.
      </p>
      <h4 class="f-3">First, Choose Colors</h4>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            You must choose a <strong>Primary Color</strong>, which is what drives the whole thing.  This can be any non-gray color, but ultimately is either something you like or someothing that has to be in the app or website. If you choose gray, Ghola will add a bit of blue to it.
        </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            You may optionally choose a <strong>Secondary Color</strong>, either to provide more variety to the algorithm described below, or because you have a second important color.  Things work better if this color is not very close to the primar color, but whatever. It's fine. If you choose gray, Ghola will add a bit of beige to it.
        </p>
      <h4 class="f-3">Next, Decide How Many</h4>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        I'm not good enough at design to do someting with more than six colors, but sometimes having a few more is handy. So you can choose either six or 12 colors.  Either way, you get a gray as well.  12 colors + a gray at 7 shades (see below) means you have 91 actual colors.  That's plenty for most situations, and probably more than you will need for most applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ghola will try its best to give you a variety of colors to supplement the one or two you chose.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            <strong>Six Colors</strong> will produce a Red, an Orange, a Yellow, a Green, a Blue, and a Purple. It will use your colors for these when possible.  For example, if your color is an Orange, you'll get a Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple to go with it.
          </p></li>
          <li><p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
              <strong>Twelve Colors</strong> will choose a Red, a Vermilion, an Orange, a Gold, a Yellow, a Chartruese, a Green, a Cyan, a Blue, a Purple, a Magenta, and a Pink. It will use your colors for these when possible.
            </p></li>
      </ul>
      <a name="wheel"></a>
      <h4 class="f-3">Decide How Other Colors are Picked</h4>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        To create base colors from your one or two, you can choose a <em>color wheel</em> which will handle that.  They both work by choosing a set of hues (based on the HSL color model) that should produce the requisite number of colors.  Because color is subjective, the results won't always be perfect, but they should be good enough.  There are two ways to go about this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            <strong>Equally-Spaced</strong> - This chooses Hues based on a 360 wheel.  Six colors means each produced color will be 60 degrees apart, and 12 being 30 degrees apart.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            When you have <em>only one color</em>, this will take the hue of that color and rotate it through the entire wheel, leaving Saturation and Lightness the same for all colors.  When you have <em>two colors</em>, it's a bit more complicated.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            With two colors, the equally-spaced wheel wil start with the first color, and rotate its hue to produce half the number of requested colors.  It will then rotate the second color's hue to produce the rest.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            As you can imagine, this wheel doesn't necessarily work super great, especially for certain pairs of colors.  But, it's conceptually easy to understand what it's doing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            The <strong>Hand-crafted</strong> wheel attempts to produce colors that are more perceptually consistent with the desired color names. If you examine a gradient of colors used for the HSL model, you can see that, for example, there are many more blues than yellows.  The hand-crafted model uses a fixed set of degrees along a 360 wheel to figure out what degree is what color. These values were chosen  by me.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            In <em>single color</em> mode, the wheel uses the primary color's hue's location along the range for its color. For example, a color with a hue of 50 is yellow, like <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #e2c11d; color: black;">#e2c11d</code>.  The range I chose for Yellow is 41 to 74, so yellow 50's location is at 27% of the way from one end of the range to the other.  Each other color is chosen using this percentage.  Thus, because purple's range from 259 to 333, the purple for this yellow would have a hue of 279, which would be <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #9d1de2; color: white;">#9d1de2</code>.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            This means that your primary color will be in the palette, and the other colors are, in theory, as much their own color as yours.  That purple is just as purple as that yellow. In theory.  For two colors, however, it's more complicated.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            In <em>two color mode</em>, both colors are used to produce two single-color wheels as described above.  These wheels are then combined to form a single wheel.  The way they are combined is noteworthy.  By default, colors HSL values are simply averaged.  So, if the primary wheel produced <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #e2c11d; color: black;">hsl(50,77,50)</code> for yellow, and the secondary produced <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #d9e090; color: black;">hsl(64,56,72)</code> for <strong>its</strong> yellow, the final yellow would be <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #ddd75a; color: black;">hsl(57,66,61)</code>.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            There is one exception and that is to attempt to keep the chosen colors in the palette.
            If you chose <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #e2c11d; color: black;">hsl(50,77,50)</code> as your primary color, and your secondary color is <em>not</em> another yellow, then there is no averaging, and the chosen color is used.  That said, if you had picked a second yellow, they would be averaged.
          </p>
          <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
            Given all this, it is possible for the wheels to miss a color.  Perhaps no green is produced by the above algorithms.  For example, suppose you chose
            <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #e2c11d; color: black;">hsl(50,77,50)</code> and
            <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #43315e; color: white;">hsl(264,32,28)</code> and no red was produced by the wheel.  To create the green, the saturation and lightness are averaged (giving <code>hsl(??,54,39)</code>), and the hue is chosen as the midway point in the range I chose for green. That range is 74–167 for six color mode, and halfway between those is 120, giving
            <code class="ph-2 pv-1 br-2" style="background-color: #2e992e; color: white;">hsl(120,54,39)</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="f-3">Choose How Many Shades of Each Color</h4>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        Next, choose the <strong>number of Shades</strong> for each color.  The options are 5 or 7. This ensures you always have a center "default" value, and then a few shades darker or lighter.  Honestly, 5 is probably enough, but sometimes one or two more might be helpful, so you can choose 7.  More than that and I just get lost trying to figure out what to use.
      </p>
      <a name="scale"></a>
      <h4 class="f-3">Pick How Those Shades are Generated</h4>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        To generate shades, choose a <strong>Scale Model</strong>.  There are probably more choices here than you need, but they all seem to be slightly different so I left them in.  These will figure out what the different shades of each color actually are.
        <ul>
          <li><p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
              <strong>chroma.js</strong> - This app uses chroma.js under the covers, and it has a scale function that this uses.  This scale model generates a scale from black to the color from the wheel to white, extracting 7 or 9 steps, then discarding the black/white ones, leaving 5 or 7 steps. It's fine.
            </p></li>
            <li><p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                <strong>Ensure Accessible Contrast</strong> - This will start from the base color and find a darker shade with a 4.5 contrast ratio to white and a lighter shade with a 4.5 contrast ratio to black.  It will then find a pair of shades (light and dark) that have a 9 contrast ratio to each other, then another pair that have a 13 ratio contrast to each other. This adjusts the lightness using the LAB color model.  Contrast is calculated using chroma.js's method, which is the WCAG method.
              </p>
              <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                Depending on the colors produced by the color wheel, there may not be enough colors to satisfy all the criteria.  In that case, any needed darker colors are produced by dividing the lightness by 2.  Lighter colors are produced by multiplying the lightness by 1.2.  I found these worked well enough.
              </p></li>
              <li>
                <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                  <strong>Fixed</strong>  There are six models that each produce a fixed set of lightness values and those are then applied to each color produced by the color wheel.  This means that each shade of each color has the same lightness as the rest.  The six models are created by multiplexing LAB vs HSL against Linear, Logarithmic, and Hand-Crafted calculations.
                </p>
                <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                  The linear models create lightness values that are equally spaced, so for a five-shade palette, that would be 1, 25, 50, 75, and 99 (all 0's or 100's are coerced to 1 and 99, respetively).  For the seven-shade palette, the percentages would be 1, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, and 99.  This value is used to set the lightness directly using either HSL or LAB.
                </p>
                <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                  The logarithmic models are more complicated, but they attempt to create colors grouped closer to the darker or lighter ends of the shade.  You can see that the LAB-based algorithm doesn't produce very light colors, but that's how LAB rolls.
                  The hand-crafted values are hard-coded by me to produce results that are more in-line with my original goal of having a wide variety of shades.  I think these are generally better than the algorithmic ones.
                </p>
                <p class="measure lh-copy mv-1 f-1">
                  <strong>One Note</strong> is the inclusion of the colors produced by the colorwheel.  As these algorithms produce lightness values, if the color-wheel-produced color's lightness should fall between two values, the algorithmic value is not used, and instead the base color's is.  For example, if using the linear scale and the lightness of the green produced by the color wheel is 45, that value would be used instead of 50.  This is done to attempt to keep the chosen colors in the palette.
                </p>
              </li>
        </ul>
      <a name="download"></a>
      <h3 class="f-4">What Do I Do With the Palettes?</h3>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        You can download the palette in a few ways to use in your project:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>CSS Variables</strong> - This will give you a <code>.css</code> file that declares the colors as variables.  Each color will use its categorical name (e.g. red, purple), and each shade will use a value from 1 (darkest) to 5 or 7 (lightest).  Note that if your color and color wheel combination resulted in more than one of the same color, the variables will have numbers to distinguish them, e.g. <code>green-1</code> and <code>green2-1</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Melange Variables</strong> - This is identical to the CSS Variables download, but the variables will use the MelangeCSS naming scheme, so you can drop them into a project using Melange CSS.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>Melange Configuration</strong> - This will produce a snippet of JavaScript that can be pasted into Melange's source code to set its palette.  Probably not what you want.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>TailwindCSS Configuration</strong> - This will produce a JavaScript configuration object you can paste into your TailwindCSS configuration.  Because Tailwind supports nine levels, the object produced here will duplicate some levels.  If you have a 5-shade palette, 100 and 200 will be the darkest, 300 and 400 the second lightest, 500 the center, 600 and 700 the second darkest, and 800 and 900 the darkest.  For the 7-shade palette, 100 and 200  will be the lightest and 800 and 900 the darkest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="measure lh-copy">
            <strong>CSV</strong> - This will produce a CSV that has the color category (e.g. Red), the color name (e.g. Maroon), and the hex code.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        Note that the URL in your browser will change as you make changes.  The behavior of the app is deterministic, so you can keep any given URL to return to the palette.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-4">Can I Tweak Things?</h3>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">
        Not really.  This is designed to be something you use quickly to make a quick decision and get some colors that are fine, so you can keep working.  It's not for hand-crafting or doing fine color work that a real designer would want to do.
