# ghola - Color Picker for Developers

This allows choosing a color palette that will provide a wide variety of shades and tints, but not too many, and such that most
combinations are accessible.

## Setup

1. Install Docker
2. `dx/build`
3. `dx/start`
4. In a new terminal: `dx/exec bin/setup`
5. Then, in two terminals:
   - `dx/exec bin/dev`
   - `dx/exec bin/run`

To build for prod:

`dx/exec bin/build production`
